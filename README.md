This repository contains the code used in the preprint "SenSet, a novel human lung senescence cell gene signature, identifies cell-specific senescence mechanisms" which can be accessed on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.21.629928v1).

SenSet is generated by running the PUc estimator on the HLCA dataset (see `notebooks/PUc_Learning.ipynb`).
